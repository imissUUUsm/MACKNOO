			<h1 class="Keigo">Keigo Takami</h1>
			<p class="info">Keigo Takami (鷹たか見み啓けい悟ご Takami Keigo?),
			   also known as Wing Hero: Hawks(ウィングヒーロー ホークス 
			   Wingu Hīrō Hōkusu?), is the former No. 3 
			   and current No. 2 Pro Hero.</p>
			<hr style="color: black;">
			<h1 class="Appearance">Appearance</h1>
			<p> Keigo is a man of average height with a slim and narrow build. 
			He himself has pointed out that his back muscles are not broad enough 
			(though this is more of a metaphor portraying his lack of ability to lead and provide stability). 
			He has feathery, ash blond hair that is swept messily backward, with some of the front tufts sticking up in arcs above his head.
			His eyebrows are notably thick, having a similar appearance to his hair, and he has faint stubble on his chin.
                        His eyes are golden-brown and rather triangular, with two small black triangles just below his tear ducts and in the top corners 
			of his eyes, making them resemble those of a bird. The marks around his eyes are natural, as it is shown that he already had them
			as a child. </p>
			
			<p>His Quirk grants him a set of large, bright red feathered wings. Although the sizing of his wings is somewhat inconsistent, 
			they are mostly shown to reach over his head when folded. </p>
			His hero costume resembles an aviator's uniform; he wears a black shirt with a wavy golden pattern, 
			over which he has a tan jacket with a high collar, the insides and cuffs of the sleeves lined with white fur, 
			and black gloves. He has a red square-shaped lobe piercing in each ear, although these are rarely visible as he 
			usually wears a pair of yellow headphones over them. His headphones most likely have protection purposes, 
			since the velocities in which he moves are capable of damaging eardrums beyond repair. 
			A rounded, yellow-tinted (blue in the manga) visor protects his eyes, presumably 
			from UV radiation above the clouds and dirt particles at high speeds.[4] His jacket is specially modified, 
			with two large slits over his shoulder blades to accommodate his wings. </p>
			
			<p>After the Paranormal Liberation War, and following several injuries given by Dabi, 
			Keigo momentarily wore a respirator mask device and communicated with a voice simulator through his phone due to his vocal cords 
			being injured and his wings burned off. As of the Dark Hero Arc, he's recovered from his wounds, as well as his vocal cords, 
			but his wings are yet to be fully restored. His hair is also cut much shorter. While the left side of his face has a jagged scar 
			from his cheek to his neck. </p>
			
			<p>By the time of the Final War Arc, Keigo now wears prosthetics on his wings, 
			so that he can try to reach his previous high speeds, as Recovery Girl's Heal Quirk was unable to properly restore them.
			He also has several katana, which he uses in place of his since-burnt feather blades.</p>

			<hr />

			<h1> Personality </h1>
			<p> Keigo is shown to be highly intelligent, both emotionally and logistically. 
			He promotes a carefree and jovial attitude, while his constant vigilance often hides under layers of serenity and equanimity. 
			Keigo acts laid-back while being on constant alert, usually speaking his mind and coming off as quite rude at times.</p>
			
			<p> Keigo follows the orders of the Hero Public Safety Commission without hesitation, but with subliminal cynicism. 
			Nevertheless, Keigo dislikes formalities, often acting unpredictably while being cocky and taunting. 
			He acts nonchalant and jokingly submissive since he does not care about social status or recognition. 
			Keigo uses a lot of sarcasm such as when he agrees serenely when Katsuki Bakugo claims to have been faster, 
			and he reacts with ironic adaptation when someone claims him to be lesser. 
			Keigo believes that popular approval is the most important metric a Pro Hero should be judged for since it is the task of a hero 
			to put the citizens at ease - something that he claims he's unable to do. 
			Keigo shows a preference for the lower hero ranks as it would allow him more freedom and avoid the burdens of being a top hero.
			He states his wish is to patrol in a free, leisurely fashion and "take it easy." </p>
			
			<p> Still, Keigo is said to be ferocious in regards to his Pro Hero duties, understanding the importance of a leader figure 
			among all heroes after All Might's retirement. 
			When around others he likes, Keigo is very talkative and can have a prolonged one-sided conversation casually 
			while helping dozens of civilians simultaneously in his area of influence. 
			He also claims that he will always strive for what he longs for. </p>
			
			<p> Keigo's cunning has been shown multiple times as he outsmarts his surveillance monitors, a
			s well as planning his actions ahead in order to have explanations for the Hood incident. 
			He is rational and more far-sighted than other Pro Heroes, allowing him the best chances to go undercover. </p>
			
			<p> He has also demonstrated his intelligence through his investigative work,
			being quickly able to deduce the truth behind One For All and its connection to All Might and Izuku Midoriya. 
			He was then able to use his analytical skills to try to better understand One For All and All For One,
			being the one to theorize All For One could never steal the Quirk because he lacks any semblance of hatred required to take it.</p>
			
			<p> He appears relaxed in situations of great pressure, such as during the Japanese Hero Billboard Chart. 
			Keigo's gestures are lively, expressive, and highly personalized, as he always wants to get his voice across. 
			He claims to be "bad at keeping it in," even though he possesses complete control over his facial expressions and body language, 
			which makes him an extremely skilled liar. </p>
			
			<p> But apparently, he adores the truth, finding lying to be too much work. These traits allowed him to easily work his way 
			into the Paranormal Liberation Front, and the slight change of motivation expertly conveyed to Endeavor the information 
			about the Front's aims and change of leadership. </p>
			
			<p> While Keigo may seem uninterested in most things, he has a good heart, 
			as he saves every single witness from Hood's attack and is silently disgusted at the strain of maintaining his duty-act as 
			a double agent amidst a cabal of villains and terrorists. </p>
			
			<p> He also feels guilty about Endeavor's scar, having coaxed the High-End attack into a contained area to reduce casualties.
			While he seems relaxed and under-challenged as typical of most prodigies, he is in fact hard-working and under constant pressure
			with his hero career. It is proclaimed that he trained endlessly to maximize the techniques in which he uses his wings, 
			refining his rescue, support, and combat abilities. </p>
			
			<p> In his childhood, his father, Takami, would force him to stay locked up in the house to ensure no one could discover and capture 
			him, and he was unable to interact with the outside world or anyone his age. Because of this, he initially believed 
			that the heroes he saw on television were just fictional characters. 
			Furthermore, he was subjected to constant physical and emotional abuse by his father. 
			Keigo would be kicked simply for turning his back to his father, who would constantly say how it would've been better 
			if Keigo was never born. Seeing how broken both of his parents were, 
			Keigo held in his emotions and became determined not to endure the same fate. </p>
			
			<p> After his father was arrested by Endeavor, Keigo realized that heroes are indeed real, 
			and his hope was reinvigorated after being freed from his father's abuse. 
			Even in his youth, Keigo showed remarkable inner strength and intelligence, 
			as despite the emotional torment caused by both his parents, he was still firm in his resolve to be a good hero like Endeavor. </p>
			
			<p> Keigo displayed his ingenuity and strength when he and his mother were forced out onto the streets, 
			and after being put down by his mother asking why she even had Keigo or what good his wings were, 
			he became determined to be useful. He intervened in a high-speed automobile crash, saving the lives of many people 
			and garnering the attention of the Hero Public Safety Commission, saving both him and his mother from their life of poverty. </p>
			
			<p>Despite his troubled past and him being taken in by a corrupted government who saw him as a mere replacement for Lady Nagant, 
			Hawks was determined to strive and become a hero like his idol, Endeavor. 
			Through the years, he underwent a harsh training regimen by the HPSC to become an undercover double agent for the safety 
			of society. By the time his training was complete, he still retained his optimism, unlike his superior. 
			He also continued to look up to his idol even after Dabi's public recording (which exposed Endeavor's past of abusing his family). 
			Keigo even went so far as to expose his own past for Endeavor's sake, believing that unlike his own father, 
			Endeavor has truly changed for the better.</p>
			
			<p>Keigo's optimistic side is what leads him to want to find the good in others, potentially due to his own personal guilt 
			over never truly forgiving his mother, something he commends Shoto over after learning of his reconciliation with his mother.</p>
			
			<p>Alongside trusting Endeavor and witnessing his growth, as well as believing Lady Nagant still has the heart of a hero 
			even after her turn to the dark side, the biggest example of his compassion was with Twice, who he managed to develop
			a genuine bond of friendship with (even while undercover). </p>
			
			<p>Having realized that Twice was truly a good person at heart, and feeling remorseful for exploiting his trust, 
			Keigo held a genuine desire to help the villain rehabilitate, even if the plan ultimately failed. </p>
